== Description ==

If your WordPress website has hundreds of pages and your theme has many page templates then sometimes you want to see the pages those are using a specific template. But by default there is no way in WordPress admin to search posts or pages associate with a template. "**[Filter Page by Template](http://onetarek.com/my-wordpress-plugins/filter-page-by-template/)**" plugin helps you to do this. It adds a dropdown list of page template above the post/page list. You can filter posts/pages by selecting a template from the dropdown. There is a new column `Template` in page list table. This `Template` column shows the name of `page template` that is being used for a particular page.
